# Arduino (Line Tracing Motorised Vehicle)

This documents the work done for the STEM training I conducted for students who were building line tracing motorised vehicle.

# Components Used
- Arduino UNO compatible
- Motors (Left and Right)
- Lego-like assembly kit
- Infrared Sensor(s) - 1 or 2 sensor configuration

# Directory
- code   -> Arduino source codes. 
- docs   -> Adobe PDF instructions to build and code the line tracing vehicle.
- videos -> Videos to show the final product i.e. 1-Infrared or 2-Infrared sensors line tracing motorised vehice.
